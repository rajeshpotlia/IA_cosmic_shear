# IA_cosmic_shear
It's a summer project that I did under the supervision of Dr. Stefano Camer, University of Turin, Italy, in the summer of 2023. The project was aimed at applying multi-tracer techniques to constrain the behaviour of intrinsic alignments (IAs), which are the dominant contamination in cosmic shear studies.\
